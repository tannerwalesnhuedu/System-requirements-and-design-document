# System-requirements-and-design-document


Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass system was a project for a first time customer who wanted to create a system for students who had not yet passed their driver's test.
They wanted a system on the cloud that was connected to the DMV for updates of rules, policies, and sample questions. 

What did you do particularly well?

I did a good job of finding and creating documentation of what the system needed to meet the cusotmers need. 


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise the limitations I would add that another limitation is if the user does not enter or send the registration the system can not help the user to improve upon the other limitations of the system.  

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I met the user's needs with loggin in as the user wanted admin access for when a customer forgets their password and needs it reset the admin of the system can do that. It is important to consider the user's needs for designing to make sure you do a good job and are making their system not your's. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I created a UML class diagram, activity diagram, sequence diagram, and a data flow diagram. I would use a activity diagram as that seems to help me grasp more of the functionality needed when creating the system.
