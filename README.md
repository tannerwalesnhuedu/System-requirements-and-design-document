# System-requirements-and-design-document


Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass system was a project for a first time customer who wanted to create a system for students who had not yet passed their driver's test.
They wanted a system on the cloud that was connected to the DMV for updates of rules, policies, and sample questions. 

What did you do particularly well?
I did a good job of finding and creating documentation of what the system needed to meet the cusotmers need. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
